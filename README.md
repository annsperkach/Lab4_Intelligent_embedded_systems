Need to implement Edge Data Logic. Namely, this part deals with data analysis from sensors on the car. It is necessary to implement the logic of collecting data from MQTT, analyzing the condition of the road surface, and sending the analyzed data to the Hub. For example, if the data on the Y axis is greater than a certain value, then we have a pit.
